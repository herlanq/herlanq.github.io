<h1>Quinn Herlan - CSCI 260-02 - Homework 1</h1>
  <p1>What I found to be the most important aspect of the reading, which to some way seem like common sense, </p1>
  <p2>is for one to accept their personal responsibility when completing a certain task. Being responsible </p2>
  <p3>is more than simply completing the task, but rather completion to the best of one's ability while also </p3>
  <p4>consdiering potential failure. In essence, this is where pragmatic programming is extremely relative </p4>
  <p5>because if the programmer is approaching a task within a larger context of the project, that includes </p5>
  <p6>being prepared to accept the responsbility of potential failure. However, as stated in the reading, </p6>
  <p7>failure should be met with possible solutions to resolve said failure. That very mindset is how </p7>
  <p8>a task is truly completely right. For even if there is failure, it should amlmost be anticipated </p8>
  <p9>to the extent of which the programmer already has numerous solutions to resolve the issue.</p9>
